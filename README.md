# -Face-Recognition
1.INTRODUCTION:
Face recognition is a biometric technology that identifies or verifies an individual's identity by analyzing and comparing facial features from an image or video. It is widely used across industries for security, authentication, and personalization purposes.Google Teachable Machine is a user-friendly, web-based tool that allows anyone to train machine learning models without coding expertise. It is ideal for beginners exploring face recognition.

2.OVERVIEW OF GOOGLE TEACHABLE MACHINE:
Google Teachable Machine is a web-based platform that democratizes machine learning by allowing users to create, train, and deploy models without requiring coding or advanced technical expertise. It's particularly suited for beginners who want to explore machine learning concepts, including face recognition, in an interactive and accessible manner.

3.Key Features
Detects faces in images and in real-time too.
Utilizes a pre-trained model from Google Teachable Machine.
Beginner-friendly and easy to customize.

4.Steps to Build a Face Recognition Model The following steps were taken to create a face recognition model:
Data Collection: Captured multiple images of faces under various conditions to improve accuracy. Categorized images into classes for training (e.g., Person A, Person B).

Testing: Validated the model with unseen face images. Evaluated accuracy, precision, and recall metrics. 

Exporting and Deployment: Exported the trained model in TensorFlow.js format. Integrated the model into a Python project using tensorflow or JavaScript for web applications.
